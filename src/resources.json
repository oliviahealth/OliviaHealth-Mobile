Today’s topic will be about **domestic violence**.\n\n---\n\n### **What is domestic violence?**\n\nDomestic violence refers to abuse that occurs between people who are in or have been in an intimate partner or romantic relationship. It can involve **physical abuse**, **psychological or emotional abuse**, and can include **financial or sexual abuse**, or **stalking**.\n\n---\n\n### **Is domestic violence more likely to occur during pregnancy?**\n\nSome statistics suggest that domestic violence, if it’s present in a relationship, may be **more likely to happen during pregnancy**, although in other relationships where abuse has been present, pregnancy may be a honeymoon time for people.\n\nWhile pregnancy can be a very exciting time for couples, it can also be a **very stressful time**, and that stress can make abuse more likely to occur.\n\n---\n\n### **What impact does domestic violence have on mental health or pregnancy?**\n\nDomestic violence is a **healthcare issue**, and is associated with many negative health outcomes. Women in relationships where domestic violence is present are at increased risk for:\n\n- **Depression**\n- **Anxiety**\n- **Suicidal thoughts or self-harm**\n- **Substance use**\n\nDuring pregnancy, domestic violence can increase the risk of:\n\n- Not gaining enough weight during pregnancy\n- Difficulty taking care of herself and the growing baby\n- **Preterm birth** and **low birth weight**\n- **Other birth complications**\n- **Higher risk of postpartum depression**\n\n---\n\n**Thank you.**\nWe appreciate you coming out here today and answering our questions.",

Today’s topic will be about **domestic violence**.\n\n---\n\n### **What is safety planning?**\n\nA **safety plan** is a plan for your safety at any stage of a relationship that may involve abuse. This could mean planning to be safe if you live with the abusive partner, planning to be safe during an abusive episode, or planning to be safe when preparing to leave.\n\nUnfortunately, one of the **most dangerous times** in abusive relationships is when a person **voices the intent to leave**, is in the **process of leaving**, or **shortly after leaving**.\n\n---\n\n### **What does a safety plan include?**\n\nA safety plan includes:\n\n- Knowing where you can go to be safe\n- Having a **trusted friend or family member** you can contact\n- Having a **safe place to stay**\n- Creating a **safe bag** in case you need to leave quickly\n\nA **safe bag** may include:\n\n- ID, credit cards, and bank cards\n- Birth certificates and Social Security cards\n- Keys and other essential documents\n\nA safety plan also involves having **resources and emergency numbers** available, and creating a **plan in case violence escalates**, including calling **911** if your safety is threatened.\n\n---",

One individual may experience certain symptoms while another may not experience them at all.\n\nWhen we talk about **anxiety**—whether during **pregnancy (prenatal)** or **after delivery (postpartum)**—it can often appear as **extreme worry**. While it is normal to care deeply when you have a new baby, **maternal anxiety** often involves **intrusive thoughts** that repeat and feel impossible to control. This type of anxiety can:\n\n- Prevent sleep\n- Prevent eating\n- Interfere with daily activities due to overwhelming worry\n\n**Depression**, on the other hand, may look like:\n\n- **Deep sadness** or **guilt**\n- A desire to **sleep excessively**\n- **Withdrawal** from meaningful or enjoyable activities\n\nYou may simply **not feel like yourself**, and the experience can differ widely from person to person. This is a general overview of how **maternal anxiety and depression** may appear.\n\n---",

It was very hard for me to admit to myself that something was wrong. I had to understand that it wasn’t anything I was doing wrong or anything I caused. It was related to how my **hormones were regulating after delivery**, and how my mind and body were adjusting — and that was okay.\n\nWhat truly made a difference was **asking my support people for help** and allowing them to be there for me. It helped me grow through those challenging periods. It also helped me **better support others**, because I came to understand how difficult it can be to ask for help.\n\nSometimes support can look like small acts, such as:\n- *“I’m going to bring you dinner.”*\n- *“I’ll help with your dishes.”*\n- *“I’ll watch your baby while you take a nap.”*\n\nThese small gestures can mean so much.\n\nThis experience gave me a **new perspective**. Now that my children are older, I no longer experience postpartum depression or anxiety, but I make sure others know that having a **personal or family history of anxiety, depression, or mental illness** can increase the risk of postpartum depression or anxiety.\n\nKnowing this about yourself — and knowing that these feelings are **common and treatable** — is empowering. There is help available, and you are **not alone**. Don’t shut people out. **Allow those who want to help, to help you.**\n\nRemember: you want to give your baby the best care possible — and to do that, you also have to **take care of yourself**.\n\n---",

I teach nursing students at the **School of Nursing for Texas A&M**, and I am also a **labor and delivery nurse**, practicing for about **12 1/2 years**.\n\n---\n\n### **How was the transition from the first pregnancy to the second, third, and fourth?**\n\nThank you for asking — I feel like this topic is not talked about enough.\n\nI have **four children**, and when we had our **first little girl**, I was very **worried and anxious**. I couldn’t sleep because I was worried about her, but I didn’t recognize it as **depression**. I thought it was just part of being a new mom.\n\nWhen we had our **second baby** less than two years later, those symptoms returned — and they were **more pronounced**. I didn’t want to sleep, and I was constantly **worried**. Around **5:00 or 6:00 PM**, I would feel a **sense of dread or grief** that I couldn’t explain. It continued for months before it eventually faded.\n\n---\n\nBetween my second and third pregnancies, I attended **nursing school**, where we learned about **depression and anxiety**. That’s when I realized I had been experiencing those symptoms before.\n\nDuring my **third pregnancy**, the feelings returned — even stronger. After delivery, I told my provider I was feeling **sad, anxious, and withdrawn**. I didn’t want to eat, shower, or take care of myself. I only wanted to **take care of the baby** and not let anyone else help. My provider diagnosed me with **postpartum depression and anxiety** and prescribed an **antidepressant**.\n\n---\n\nAfter starting medication, it took about **four to five months** to begin feeling better. When we decided to have our **fourth baby**, I was anxious knowing those feelings might return. I spoke with my provider again, and she started me on medication in my **third trimester** so it could take effect before delivery.\n\nEven so, the symptoms came back **very strongly** after birth. I was hospitalized and am **grateful** the medication was already in my system. It took about **a year** to feel like myself again.\n\n---\n\nAcross pregnancies, my **maternal anxiety and depression symptoms intensified**, but I became **more aware** of them over time. With my first two, I didn’t talk about it. I felt **ashamed** because I didn’t feel the excitement everyone said I should. I felt **guilty and embarrassed**.\n\nBy my third and fourth pregnancies, I was **more self-aware** and involved my **support system**. My **husband was a great support**, and I learned to be open with my **health provider**.\n\nIt is **okay to ask for help**, and it is **okay to give yourself grace**.\n\n---",

We were told they might come home at different times. In our case, **one daughter came home at day 55**, and the **other two at day 73**.\n\n---\n\n### **What were the procedures for visiting in the NICU?**\n\n- **Controlled access:** Call a phone at the door; the **charge nurse** verifies and buzzes you in.\n- **Handwashing:** Scrub at the big sinks for **3 minutes** every time you enter.\n- **Approved visitor list:** Up to **10 people** per family/baby.\n- **PPE:** **Yellow gowns** (and often **shoe covers**). Typically **one baby per person per day**.\n\nThese steps prioritize **safety and infection control**.\n\n---\n\n### **How did you deal with the emotional aspect and bond with the babies?**\n\n- Our **nurses and doctors were amazing**, treating **Dad and Mom equally**.\n- We had **24-hour access**; Dad often visited at **3 a.m.** for **kangaroo care**.\n- **Child life specialists** taught our older kids (and us) about wires, tubes, and holding babies safely.\n\n---\n\n### **How did you manage two children at home and three in the hospital?**\n\nIt was a **juggling act**:\n- Dad drove **~7,000 miles** in two months.\n- **School staff** supported the older two.\n- **Family, church, and friends** helped with meals and logistics.\n- A **retired couple** hosted us and became *surrogate grandparents*.\n\n**NICU brain** is real — community support mattered.\n\n---\n\n### **What kept you going?**\n\n- Gratitude.\n- Confidence the journey was temporary.\n- **“Fight like a preemie.”**\n- Staff celebrated every small milestone.\n\n---\n\n### **What surprised you about the NICU?**\n\n- The family-centered care.\n- Thoughtful gestures.\n- The emotional **roller coaster**.\n- How seriously safety is taken — e.g., delaying discharge to ensure stability.\n\n---",

It’s so good to be here.\n\n---\n\n### **What is your experience of being a military mom?**\n\nIt’s kind of like **drinking from a fire hose** — there is so much information for a first-time mom. I’d say I’m **exhausted**, but it’s also the most **fun** I’ve ever had. My little one will be **12 weeks** on Wednesday.\n\nI’ve been blessed with a strong **community of family and friends** and a **supportive husband**.\n\n---\n\n### **What was it like to be pregnant during the military?**\n\nI’ve been in the **National Guard for eight years**, and being a mom in the military is definitely a **challenge**. Some tasks were manageable, others not. For example, working in the **motor pool** at **8½ months pregnant** was tough. My unit modified my workload per **Army standards**.\n\nA major challenge is **childcare during training**. **Breastfeeding** and physical presence expectations create unique hurdles.\n\n---\n\n### **Any health concerns during your pregnancy?**\n\nI was diagnosed with **gestational diabetes** at **10 weeks**, caught early due to **risk factors**.\n\nI didn’t know that **race and ethnicity** can be predictive **risk factors**. That opened my eyes to **health equity** and differences in care.\n\n---\n\n### **What resources helped you during pregnancy?**\n\nTwo main things: **research** and **community**.\n- **Scientific studies and expert guidance**\n- A **strong support network** — *it takes a village*\n\n---\n\n### **What is your advice to new moms?**\n\n- **Trust your instincts**\n- **Ask questions**\n- **Reach out for help**\n- **Soak in the moments**\n\n---\n\n### **Have you experienced mom guilt?**\n\nAbsolutely. I worry daily and am learning to **give myself grace**. As my baby learns the world, **I’m learning to be his mom**.\n\n---\n\n### **What are your thoughts on health equity?**\n\nBeing a **Black woman** and **pregnant** was scary due to higher **maternal risks**. I feared being **another statistic**.\n\n**Being informed** made me **proactive**, not more afraid. My **husband** advocated for me, and my **OB team** was supportive.\n\n*“If she’s not worried, I’m not worried.”*\n\n---",
