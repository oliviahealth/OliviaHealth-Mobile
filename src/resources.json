have practiced for about 12 and a half years now [Music] thank you for asking because I do feel like this topic is not talked a lot about or talked enough about and for me personally I do have four children and when we had our first little girl the feelings that I had I was very worried I was very anxious I couldn't sleep because I was worried about her but I didn't identify that as depression I just thought that was normal or I just thought it was something I was going through when we had our second baby which was less than two years later I noticed that those symptoms came back and they were a little bit more pronounced I was not wanting to sleep I was always worried about the baby I um you know there was a certain time at night usually you know five or six pm in the evening that I would just get this really bad feeling this feeling of dread this feeling of grief couldn't really identify it but I knew that it was going to happen every night and it was it was just kept happening so after a couple of months those feelings started to go away and you know I took care of my babies I stayed busy with that but didn't really identify it as a problem at that time now in between my second and third I went to nursing school and we talked about depression we talked about anxiety and I realized that I was showing some of those symptoms but couldn't identify them at the time when I had my third baby I I started to have some of those feelings of anxiety and depression towards the end of my pregnancy and I was very worried about the baby those feelings that I had had with my previous started to come back and they again were more profound so every time you have a baby these symptoms of anxiety and depression are going to get more intense with each pregnancy so I went ahead and talked to my provider after delivery and said you know I'm feeling very bad I I feel sad I'm worried about the baby all the time I don't want to I don't want to eat I don't want to shower I don't really want to take care of myself all I want to do is take care of this baby and I don't want anybody to help me so she said it sounded like I was having depression and some anxiety and so she went ahead and prescribed me an antidepressant so after I started taking the depressed antidepressant I you know those those medications can take a couple weeks to kind of start working so I would say by about four to five months is when I really started to feel a lot better on the medication I wasn't worrying about the baby as much and I could I was getting back to my normal self so when we decided to have our fourth baby I knew those feelings were going to come back and I was very worried about those feelings it actually gave me some anxiety to know that I was about to go through this very big change and have those feelings again so I went ahead and talked to my provider and I was started on an antidepressant my third trimester about 36 weeks before I delivered so that it the medicine could get in my system and then hopefully help with some of those feelings after the baby was born unfortunately the feelings came back very strong I was in the hospital with them and I'm very thankful that I would start on the medication early because I don't know how bad those those feelings would have gotten without the medication but um I would say it took me about a year to start feeling myself again after after everything as far as a transition as far as maternal anxiety and depression I would say the symptoms became more pronounced but I was able to identify them more with my third and fourth pregnancy and I also recognize what I needed in that time to help me get through those those things I think with my first and my second I didn't want to talk about it I couldn't identify it but I also realized that I was feeling very different than what most or what people tell you you're supposed to feel like right so you are supposed to be happy and you're supposed to be excited about this baby but I was feeling quite the opposite and so I felt like I was doing something wrong that was not something I wanted to talk about that was not something I wanted to share I was embarrassed and I kind of wanted to know what was wrong with me that I wasn't excited now absolutely I loved my babies adored my babies but I still had this this feeling that just kind of loomed so when I went into my third and my fourth I was more aware and I wanted to make sure that I talked to my family and my support to make sure that they were there for me when I was going through this you know the first two pregnancies it was very hard to let people in but then I realized that that was exactly what I needed to do so my husband was a great support person getting my health provider you know to let her know that I needed extra help and that was okay and and I had to you know give myself a break that that it's okay to ask for help which it can be very hard for a new mom to do so.",

father of the five including the one boy who I like to call my Lone Ranger [Music] thank you so with multiples comes a multiple of factors no pun intended we were told that there would be the possibility that they could all come home at the same time two could come home one would be there one could come home to be there just all the varieties of ways in which they could come home what ended up happening is one of the girls came home at 55 days and then the other two came home at 73 days [Music] so the NICU did have controlled access for both to control security and exposure for not just our babies that were Nikki but all the babies that were in the NICU there was a phone that you'd call and the charge nurse would answer it and you would tell her who you were there to see and then she would Buzz the door you'd go in and it was a room with big sinks and have to wash your hands for three minutes and then you could go into the NICU this was a procedure you had to do every time so even if I had to step out into the hallway to take a phone call when I go back in had the charge nurse and washed hands again and that was just for safety security of not only our children but all the children in the NICU so another thing to note was that we actually had a list for our family that was maintained by the nurses and each family represented in the NICU or each baby represented and then thank you you could put I believe it was 10 people on your list who were approved to go in and see your babies and it as as our time in the NICU progressed that dwindled a little bit as some precautions got tighter due to flu season and RSV season but our older children were able to go in and see the NICU and see the babies uh we we all had to wear the yellow gowns when we were going to hold the babies and typically each person was only allowed to hold one baby a day which was very difficult for me as Mom going in to see three babies but I definitely understood the reasoning why we were not near our home so we couldn't go and shower or clean up between babies so there was always the chance of spread adding germs and they didn't want that to happen and of course neither did we so it was important that we maintained those sanitary procedures so the gowns in addition to also shoe covers I believe were also necessary [Music] so for me one of the best things about our particular NICU experience is the nurses and Doctor the staff as a whole was amazing and welcoming oftentimes you hear about dads not necessarily being treated equal to mom however that was not our experience and as I've actually come to find out through volunteering with March of Dimes that we actually had a very great and positive experience that a lot of dads don't get but me as a father the nursing staff doctor staff treated me the same as Mom they always we had Primary Care nurses who whenever they they would call and check in give they since they knew I was living back home in College Station and the girl over in Houston they would do the daily report for mom who was generally at the hospital at the time but then the evening report they would always call me and give the girl stats how they'd done that day what their feedings were like and then also they would just check in and say how's the week been going for you Dad how are things going with the older two so they they really focused on providing a Whole Health Care for us not just from the physical aspect but checking in on our mental health as parents and to see how we're doing with the hospital and the visitation they had 24-hour access which was nice because again with our children they were actually only limited to 20 30 minutes of time during their visit and oftentimes on weekends whenever everybody was down I would wake up like at three in the morning and just go to the hospital and hold babies for two or three hours and I got a luckily I had a lot of button-up shirts and so what I do is just sit there unbutton my shirt put them in and do the kangaroo care and just hold hold babies you know I it was a tough experience but loved every minute of it we also were blessed to be able to access some resources that the hospital provided for us um there's a child life specialist on staff there who was able to when our older children did come visit you know would she would come in and do visits and explain to them what those wires were for on their sisters why they needed to wear those that they weren't hurting them this is how we put it on you know when you're holding them make sure that it stays where it's supposed to and so that was great to have that explanation not just for them but for me too for me to understand why they were wearing things and to know that those weren't so scary and that it was okay if one got bumped off here and there uh and one could pull tubes out and she did and so having that explanation of those resources was really great for us [Music] it was a juggling act and then some um you know I was working full-time had to it was no choice the children had school we were very lucky in that we are public that we are public Educators we know the system and have friends that work in all districts and their teachers we were friends with the counselor at their school that our older two would go with so she was on top of them as far as making sure all their needs were met and we're able kind of knowing what we were would be facing that year she very specifically picked out all of their teachers for them um knowing that they would just need more than an education that year for me his dad just uh did a lot of driving for two months I logged I think roughly 7 000 miles driving back and forth to Houston uh was worth every minute um I would have to say that family and friends came out from everywhere her sister lives in Houston my parents both of our parents are from Waco so we had family very close by we have lots of friends from having been in the community for the amount of time we had we had friends all the time doing stuff like I would come home um Wednesday from my midweek visit to the girls and would find gift cards under our doormat we would we we would Sunday evening when I was driving back with the older two kids if you're getting phone calls say hey I know you are headed back from Houston what time are you going to be back and that's a expect to be back around this time like okay uh well dinner will be at your house by this time very very coordinated effort of the community around us I would say that kept things going back at home um and kept me in Houston truthfully I was very lucky when the girls were first born we immediately began planning I said I'm not leaving them here at the hospital without me and we didn't know how we were going to make that work and our community around us really rallied and through the kindness of friends who reached out to their friends I ended up moving in with a sweet retired couple in Houston who had never met me and I had never met them and they said she can come live with us and they became our surrogate grandparents and would drive me back and forth to the hospital and pack my lunchbox every day and just were amazing and Eric would come when he would come midweek he would also stay with them when he would bring the older kids up on the weekend they would come and stay with them and swim in their pool and we just became family and so knowing that there was such a coordinated effort from our church family and our community back home who really like Eric said rallied around and made sure every need that we had was met from the lawn being mode to the house being cleaned just laundry everything we could rest assured that if anything came up that needed to be taken care of they were going to be there and including when the girls were transferred from Houston back to the hospital and College Station we had a team community of people who were waiting outside the hospital to meet them and pray over them as they were locked inside so it was really we learned a lot about our community during that time which was very important because you hear about the quote-unquote pregnancy brain and things that happen well Nick your brain is about a thousand times worse [Music] I think for me because I was there really every day uh and seeing the babies around us who were not as blessed as we were and whose moms and dads couldn't be there with them every day and who had to go back to work and there was no other option they didn't have they weren't blessed with the community that we had so knowing that I needed to take advantage of the fact that I could be there and just be so thankful that I could be helped me a lot and knowing that it wouldn't be that way forever and that all my babies were healthy and that they were going to go home when so many around us were facing such harder trials than we were and babies who were so sick and had been there already for so long and just had there they didn't know when they were going to get home and so being able to to appreciate my situation but also walk through with other families really meant a lot to me in my journey um and knowing that my kids were in such good hands with their dad back home say the theme fight like a preemie the girls showed it every single day we the good thing that the NICU nurses and doctors do is they celebrate every single Milestone no mouth no matter how big or small I mean if it was today they went from eight millimeters to 10 millimeters of feeding they were celebrating it's today they kept their feeding tube in for the whole feeding as you mentioned Sylvie didn't ever did not cooperate with that and we had the friend that had to crochet an octopus which we will bring one day but every single Victory no matter how big or small the NICU staff made sure we were and celebrated and so it was it was very good because it showed that progress is progress no matter how big or small is and and it just showed that they were improving they were getting healthier day by day bit by day and that there would be an end to a journey they couldn't tell us when and didn't want to tell us when to not get our hopes up but they could always assure us that hey this is progress we are moving forward word every child is going to move at their own pace but we we are moving forward and so just having that constant not only having that constant hearing that constant reassurance but seeing it seeing them growth remember the first day that she sent me pictures like look real close and like oh my goodness that's so amazing now there are premium clothes and they still swallowed them up but it was it's wonderful because they had only been swaddled up to this point and couldn't wear real clothes and so now that they're big enough to actually put up real clothes it's like that was a huge thing for both of us to to see them like now they're almost they're real babies yeah they're real babies [Music] the bedside manner of doctors and nurses as I've spoken on many times that's one of the things that I will admire brag about tell everybody about until the day that I die is that the care provided by the doctors and nurses not only for our babies but again how much they focus on what I tell people as a whole family care in their their concerned for my health my mental health my well-being their concern for moms mental health moms mental well-being the NICU nurses you know we were in there for several holidays so like two of our primary nurses both made these amazing goodie bags for our older children for Halloween they um just their it's you know our doctor's experience that one just been minimal because we were both healthy had never had really any surgery or anything so didn't know what to expect but we had been told we do have friends who had babies in NICU and one of the things that one of them told us was um actually one particular friend whenever we found out that she was being life-flighted and she came up to visit me at the hospital before I raced to Houston she hugged my neck and she told me the last thing she told me was you're about to meet the most amazing medical people in the world and it's definitely true that being said I think it's I've talked about how lucky we were um we've heard so many stories from other families who had children in the NICU who didn't have the same experience that we did um so we do realize that every experience is different but ours was incredibly blessed we were also blessed in that our babies were such such Fighters and we're so healthy to begin with and like I said we didn't have surgeries we didn't have sickness you know and so many other families dealt with so much that was so hard and so I think that that maybe was the most surprising for me I guess within NICU families there's there's a saying that the NICU is a roller coaster and some days you're at the top and you can get to the bottom just as quickly and we we did have days like that especially early on where you know when things weren't so sure and they weren't so strong and they weren't so healthy yet and we would be doing really well and then the next day we would take and we were having a lot more episodes of apnea and breathing stopping and a couple of times when they did have to be resuscitated early on or caffeine things things like that so I think that maybe was the biggest shock for me of the NICU I guess is how different one day can be from the last you you can leave one day thinking okay we're doing great like they were awesome today there were no problems I remember talking to Eric at 11 o'clock at night sometimes and being like yeah they were all doing so good today they looked great and then I would get there at eight in the morning and they would be like yeah yeah I had 14 Brady's during the night and it was like oh but I thought we were doing so well um and you know the same with other families around us that you know one day was great and oh they're talking maybe we'll go home this weekend but then you know go home day would come and it was no we're gonna be here another week so just how different I think every day could be um and riding the Nikki roller coaster quite literally I think was a shock for us along the same lines when talking about the NICU roller coaster the one of the surprising things which is good is how serious they do take their health care and the apnea and the breathing and the heartbeat Sylvie who is the one that discharged first her initial discharge date she actually had an episode of that and they said no she's not going home today we want to keep her for three more days to Monitor and make sure that this doesn't happen again so while at that time it was very disheartening because we were so excited already I taken off from work and we were ready to bring her home but that happened but at the same time we know that there's a reason for that happen if that that it's good that it's there it was there and that the professionals are taking it that serious and they weren't going to waive because we could get home and she could have it and we don't have any of the fancy monitors or machines hooked up to her and something could happen while she's sleeping and we would have no clue.",

      "transcript": "Today I'm in conversation with Essence yd and we're going to talk about the topic minority Health Equity we're so glad to have you here thank you it's so good to be here [Music] wow it's kind of like drinking from a water hose or a fire hose there is so much information out there for a first-time mom I would say that I am exhausted but it's also the most fun I've ever had my little one here will be 12 weeks on Wednesday and it's been a huge adjustment but I've been blessed to have a great community of family and friends and a wonderful supportive partner in my husband and I would say we're making it [Music] so I've been a part of the National Guard for the past eight years and being a mom in the military is something that I knew would be a bit of a struggle and it starts when you're pregnant there were a lot of things that I still wanted to do and was able to do but there were some aspects of my job that I couldn't do as well something about being out in the motor pool working on a diesel truck eight and a half months pregnant probably wasn't the best idea so I was lucky that my unit did have a modified workload for me according to Army standards so I was able to still do my job and do my training but in a way that worked with my pregnant body one thing that does make it difficult is when I do go to training having reliable Child Care is a big concern for myself as well as a lot of other military families and I do think it is harder sometimes on the military moms because with the dads they're expected to go away with military moms we're expected to be there so when I go to trading and I'm breastfeeding it just creates a little bit of a different challenge that you have to work through [Music] I did have several different health concerns or complications during my pregnancy I was diagnosed with gestational diabetes when I was about 10 weeks pregnant typically they don't even test for that until much later but I did have some risk factors that had been identified and I am so grateful that they tested me early and identified it early and that I was able to manage it better throughout my pregnancy I didn't even know that I that race and ethnicity was one of the predictive factors for that or I should say risk factors to be more specific and that was one of the things that really opened my eyes to the differences uh and health care and the differences in a disease and complication presentation amongst different ethnicities as well [Music] I am all about two things I would say number one would be research I place a lot of weight on the research and studies and opinions of the experts so I do spend a lot of time reading up on best practices for infants and child rearing and everything and then the other one is just Community I have such a large group of really amazing amazing women and moms and dads in this community and I do my best to pick their brains because maybe they've experienced something that I haven't so when they say that it takes a village I really lean into that [Music] my advice to other new moms is that you do know your baby best don't be afraid to voice concerns that you're having don't be afraid to ask questions there are no dumb questions when we're all trying to do what's best for our babies reach out if you need help whether that's mentally physically emotionally reach out to someone you trust friend family member professional and soak it all in this is only my first time but it's already going by so fast and just embrace it [Music] there is so much Mom guilt and it can be triggered by just about anything really and we're all just trying to do our best but still I worry every day am I feeding him enough is he sleeping enough when I go back to work how will I feel dropping him off at daycare letting someone else raise my kid and all of those thoughts just kind of jumble together in your head and it's something that I'm slowly trying to work through and give myself Grace to figure things out day by day and you know I'm not going to be a perfect mom none of us are we can't be and that's not the goal or it shouldn't be because you're just going to fall short every time so just learning to be gentle with myself and gentle with him because as much as he's learning to be a person in the world I I'm learning to be somebody's mom for the first time too [Music] so being a black woman because I can't answer every question so being a black woman and Pregnant was a bit of a scary time for me because I do like to research and I had seen the statistics on black mothers and complications in pregnancy and maternal death in black women is typically higher so going into pregnancy I was terrified I was terrified to be pregnant I was terrified to give birth I was scared that Sonny was going to miss something or I would just end up being another statistic and what helped me was once again being armed with the research so I did know the statistics but knowing them and trying not to be scared by them uh helped me be knowledgeable going into it so I could kind of reassure myself in some ways I also have a very supportive partner who was willing to be an advocate for me throughout the whole experience which was so immensely helpful and then finally my care team was absolutely phenomenal my OB just walked me through the gestational diabetes and was a wealth of knowledge and reassurance and by the end of it I said if she's not worried I'm not worried.",
